# Learn Programming Languages

This repository describes a framework to learn new programming languages in a fast, reliable and reproducible way. One of the biggest problems in learning multiple programming languages is that in order to master them you need to constantly practice, but it's not possible to use every one of them everyday. I'm trying to solve this problem by using this framework and its resulting programs as a reference for whenever I've already learned a language, but need a quick reminder to use it in a new project.



## About The Framework

The framework I'm about to describe is highly based off of the [Learn Code The Hard Way](https://shop.learncodethehardway.org/) series. You don't have to follow it exactly the way I'm doing and there's no guarantee this approach will work for you as much as it does for me, but I think it's worth the attempt.


### Step 1) Read a book about the language
The first step consists in learning a book about the language while making annotations on **how common programming language structures are defined in this language**, and copying every example/exercises in the book.


### Step 2) Implement common programs
Choose a set of small programs and implement them in every language you learn. It's important to stick to the set of programs you choose, because eventually you'll get used to them, so it'll be **easier to understand what they mean and spot differences between equivalent programs in different programming languages**. A good choice would be to implement computer science algorithms, as they usually require some features that might differ depending on the language you're using, like recursion. Another reason why this could be nice is that they could later be used to benchmark performance and make comparisons between the languages you've learned.


### Step 3) Make a project
Choose a project and implement it in every language you learn. This is very similar to the previous step, but you should **pick a bigger project that uses features common to most programming languages**. A good example of project would be a raytracer, since it's a relatively simple project, but will potentially use most features that are commonly found in programming languages.

**Reminder to cite which features the raytracer project uses**.


### Step 4) (Optional) Make a web project
For web languages, it's useful to **learn its frameworks and make a project using them**. This step depends on whether you're learning the language to use it in web development and which area of web development you're currently interested in (front-end, back-end, dev-ops etc).
